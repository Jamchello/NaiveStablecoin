  "description": "NodeJS server which is responsible for updating the value of ETH in GBP (Â£) on my Ropsten Oracle contract. Makes use of the CoinGecko API to make this possible. ## Assumptions 1. Security is not of importance: private key kept in plaintext. 2. CoinGecko cannot be used to manipulate the price (single source of information is not a good idea!!) 3. Fetching the pricing data every 60 seconds is an acceptable frequency (of course within such a volatile market this would not be ideal in a production stage product)",
